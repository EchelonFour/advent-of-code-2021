# My Advent of Code 2021

Complete solution solve.
All done in typescript as ESM modules for nodejs (maybe would work in deno with some prodding).
All of my solutions should be generic enough to process any input. (Even day 24).

Some of these were done fast, some were done well, and a few were neither. All of them follow my extremely strict formatting and lint rules, though.
